# Semantra

Semantra is a pilot-ready semantic integration workbench for analyst-guided schema mapping, review, governance, and reuse.

It combines deterministic profiling and ranking with bounded AI assistance so a team can:

- upload source and target structures from row data, schema specs, or SQL snapshots
- generate explainable source-to-target or source-to-canonical mapping proposals
- review explicit source -> concept -> target paths and canonical coverage
- generate technical mapping analysis summaries and optional narration/audio
- author structured Transformation Design specs, preview output, and generate starter Pandas, PySpark, or dbt artifacts
- refine generated artifacts through controlled LLM prompts with accept/discard workflow
- persist governed mapping sets, benchmark datasets, transformation test sets, and correction history
- manage canonical concepts, overlays, and stewardship workflows through a dedicated Canonical Console
- search, inspect, and reuse approved integration knowledge through the Catalog
- measure quality through benchmark runs, profile comparison, correction impact, and explanation surfaces

The current product shape is a FastAPI backend plus a Streamlit product UI. It is already useful for demos, pilot workflows, and controlled analyst/governance review. It is not yet a production ETL runtime, scheduler, or connector-heavy integration platform.

A complementary package lives in `semantra_agent/`: it exposes the core mapping, knowledge, and bounded LLM runtime as a reusable Python SDK with backend adapters and agent integration helpers for LangChain and LangGraph. That package is documented separately in `semantra_agent/README.md` and is intended as a programmatic integration surface rather than a replacement for the Streamlit analyst UI.

## Current Product Surface

Top-level UI areas:

- `Workspace`
	- upload, profile, map, review, decide, preview, codegen, artifact refinement, and the main `Workspace Copilot` panel
- `Governance`
	- `Canonical Console`, canonical concept registry, overlay lifecycle, canonical-gap stewardship, and stable glossary promotion
- `Catalog`
	- searchable integration inventory, concept-centric reuse views, and workspace-fit explanation for approved reuse candidates
- `Benchmarks`
	- benchmark dataset save/run flows, scoring-profile comparison, correction impact, run history, and bounded explanation
- `System`
	- runtime config, observability, sidebar support surfaces, and operational reset/runtime checks

Core implemented capabilities:

- CSV, JSON, XML, XLSX, SQL snapshot, and schema-spec ingestion
- source-side and target-side companion metadata enrichment over uploaded dataset handles
- standard source-to-target mapping and canonical-only source-to-concept mapping
- explainable multi-signal ranking with optional closed-set LLM validation
- configurable canonical candidate pool shortlisting before full canonical scoring
- Mapping Analysis Overview with optional narration/audio generation
- Review Queue Plan and Gap Queue Summary for queue-level review guidance
- opportunistic LLM decision proposals for `needs_review` rows with optional live LLM fill
- proposal apply workflows (`Apply selected` and `Apply safe`) with stale-state protection
- local decision-origin audit trail (`manual_mapping`, `llm_proposal`) surfaced in Active Decisions
- mapping decision audit persistence through decision JSON export/import
- per-row and batch LLM mapping refinement with transient field context and accept/revert controls
- structured Transformation Design authoring with reusable target-grain, global rule, defaults, examples, and field-rule inputs
- JSON-based import/apply of a structured transformation spec into the Transformation Design form
- transformation generation, templates, advisory preview, and Pandas/PySpark/dbt starter generation
- canonical-mode manual mapping and canonical-mode code generation against virtual canonical targets
- LLM-based artifact refinement with split-view compare and accept/discard actions
- governed mapping-set persistence with status, audit, diff, and approved-only reuse
- correction persistence and reusable correction-rule promotion
- canonical glossary import/export, knowledge overlays, stewardship items, and Canonical Console workflows
- integration catalog search/detail/reuse flows with workspace reuse-fit assessment
- benchmark datasets, evaluation runs, scoring-profile comparison, correction impact, and benchmark explanation
- compact sidebar operations strip and unified status legend for cross-surface orientation
- dismissible onboarding hints per top-level area (`Workspace`, `Governance`, `Catalog`, `Benchmarks`, `System`)
- main-panel `Workspace Copilot` closure/readiness/output guidance in `Review`, `Decisions`, and `Output`, mirrored with the sidebar `WS Copilot`
- rerun-safe `Workspace Copilot` section handoffs that now queue pending navigation instead of mutating widget-bound active navigation state mid-render

For the full grounded feature inventory, see `project_docs/current_state.md`.

## Guided AI Surfaces

Semantra does not use LLMs as an autonomous mapper. The current bounded AI surfaces are:

- closed-set mapping validation inside the ambiguity band
- Mapping Analysis Overview, narration, and audio generation
- transformation code generation
- artifact refinement in `Workspace > Output`
- review queue planning in `Workspace > Review`
- `Workspace Copilot` review-closure, decision-readiness, and output-gating guidance in the main panel and sidebar
- canonical-gap suggestion and queue summary
- benchmark explanation
- catalog workspace reuse-fit explanation

Each of these surfaces is optional, inspectable, and backed by deterministic fallback behavior where applicable.

They now share one bounded prompt contract across the backend: static prompt text lives in `backend/app/services/prompt_templates.py`, runtime requests are split into explicit `SYSTEM`, `TASK`, and labeled payload sections, and planner-style prompts use neutral `baseline_*` payload hints instead of `fallback_*` prompt anchoring.

For mapping specifically, the LLM path is now split into two bounded steps: the validator chooses only the best target inside the closed candidate set, and transformation generation runs as a separate follow-up call only after a target has been selected.

## Quick Start

### 1. Install dependencies

Use a Python environment and install the project requirements from the repo root.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Configure optional runtime settings

If needed, create `backend/.env` and set values such as:

- `SEMANTRA_ADMIN_API_TOKEN`
- `SEMANTRA_LLM_PROVIDER`
- `SEMANTRA_LLM_MODEL`
- `SEMANTRA_LMSTUDIO_BASE_URL`
- `SEMANTRA_OPENAI_API_KEY`
- `SEMANTRA_GEMINI_API_KEY`
- `SEMANTRA_DBT_MATERIALIZATION`
- `SEMANTRA_DBT_SOURCE_MODE`
- `SEMANTRA_DBT_SOURCE_NAME`
- `SEMANTRA_DBT_SOURCE_TABLE_NAME`
- `SEMANTRA_DBT_REF_NAME`
- `SEMANTRA_DBT_QUOTE_IDENTIFIERS`
- `SEMANTRA_DBT_SOURCE_CTE_NAME`

Example `backend/.env` snippet for dbt starter conventions:

```env
SEMANTRA_DBT_MATERIALIZATION=table
SEMANTRA_DBT_SOURCE_MODE=source
SEMANTRA_DBT_SOURCE_NAME=sap_raw
SEMANTRA_DBT_SOURCE_TABLE_NAME=customer_extract
SEMANTRA_DBT_REF_NAME=stg_customer
SEMANTRA_DBT_QUOTE_IDENTIFIERS=false
SEMANTRA_DBT_SOURCE_CTE_NAME=stage_input
```

Use `SEMANTRA_DBT_SOURCE_MODE=ref` when the generated model should read from `{{ ref(...) }}` instead of `{{ source(...) }}`.

### 3. Start the app

Windows-friendly launcher:

```powershell
./start_semantra.ps1
```

This starts:

- API at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`
- Streamlit UI at `http://127.0.0.1:8501`

Manual start is also possible:

```bash
python -m uvicorn app.main:app --reload --app-dir backend --reload-dir backend
python -m streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```

## Runtime Notes

### Admin token

If you want protected governance/admin flows enabled, set `SEMANTRA_ADMIN_API_TOKEN` in `backend/.env`, then restart the backend or call `POST /observability/config/reload` with the token in `X-Admin-Token`.

### LLM providers

The app supports bounded LLM use for validation, review guidance, transformation generation, artifact refinement, benchmark explanation, canonical-gap assistance, and reuse-fit assessment.

Prompt authoring is intentionally code-backed rather than environment-configured. Runtime config still controls provider, model, and timeout behavior, while static prompt wording is centralized in `backend/app/services/prompt_templates.py`.

For a full prompt inventory showing each static template, dynamic payload builder, and response contract, see `docs/reference/LLM_PROMPT_MATRIX.md`.

For the checklist used to evaluate future prompt revisions, see `docs/reference/LLM_PROMPT_EVALUATION_CHECKLIST.md`.

Example for LM Studio:

- `SEMANTRA_LLM_PROVIDER=lmstudio`
- `SEMANTRA_LLM_MODEL=<model-identifier>` or `SEMANTRA_LLM_MODEL=auto`
- `SEMANTRA_LMSTUDIO_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:1234/v1/chat/completions`

### Scoring note

The mapping confidence score is a normalized multi-signal heuristic, not a calibrated probability.

- the final score is normalized into `0..1`
- current thresholds are `high >= 0.85`, `medium >= 0.65`, otherwise `low`
- current auto-accept threshold is `>= 0.75`, separate from the confidence-label buckets
- treat the score as review prioritization, not as a guarantee that a mapping is correct
- the active score profile is configurable via `SEMANTRA_SCORING_PROFILE` (`balanced`, `schema_only`, `data_rich`, `canonical_first`)
- the active profile can be fine-tuned with `SEMANTRA_SCORING_WEIGHT_OVERRIDES` as a JSON object in `backend/.env`
- compare built-in scoring profiles locally with `backend/scripts/run_scoring_profile_benchmark.py`

For the detailed reference on signals, weights, confidence labels, and bounded LLM validation cases, see `docs/reference/MAPPING_SIGNALS_AND_SCORING.md`.

For the detailed reference on benchmark metrics, confidence buckets, and correction-impact interpretation, see `docs/reference/BENCHMARK_METRICS_AND_CORRECTION_IMPACT.md`.

## Product Boundaries

Semantra today is:

- a pilot-grade semantic mapping and governance workbench
- deterministic-first, with bounded AI assistance
- centered on reviewability, explainability, and reusable semantic knowledge

Semantra today is not yet:

- a production batch orchestration platform
- a connector-heavy ingestion platform
- a multi-step enterprise workflow engine
- a DB-only canonical authoring platform without file-backed reseed inputs
- a durable multi-user job runtime with persistent queue semantics

## Session Continuity Today

Semantra currently treats browser session state as local UI state.

- if the browser is closed, transient Workspace state is not automatically restored on the next day
- continuing work is supported through explicit persisted artifacts: saved draft sessions, saved mapping-set versions, and exported mapping JSON/Excel
- current draft-session continuity is intentionally minimal: save, list, load, and bounded restore for the active review/decision contract
- draft-session restore now also revives bounded output snapshots for preview, generated/refined artifacts, and mapping-analysis summary/script when they were explicitly saved with the draft

## Authorization Posture Today

Semantra does not yet have enterprise-wide RBAC across the full product.

- most protected governance and admin surfaces still use the existing `X-Admin-Token` model
- a minimal principal plus role bootstrap now exists in the backend for the first pilot RBAC slice
- that pilot slice currently covers only `mapping/draft-sessions*` and `mapping/sets*`
- when no admin token is configured, the backend still allows a development-friendly fallback principal; that is useful for local work, not a production security posture

For the detailed role and endpoint breakdown, see `docs/reference/RBAC_ACTION_AND_ENDPOINT_MATRIX.md`.

## Immediate Next Steps

The next project focus is not more feature sprawl. It is validation and product proof:

1. keep the documentation fully aligned with the real current state of the product so pilot users, reviewers, and stakeholders all see the same truthful picture
2. run more manual pilot flows and proof-of-concept checks that show where the product actually saves time, improves review quality, or increases reuse
3. turn those runs into organization-facing evidence through presentations, live demos, screenshots, and repeatable runbooks
4. only after that validation gate, decide which enterprise-wide hardening investments are justified next: broader RBAC, deeper persistence, longer-running job runtime, and wider productization
