# Semantra Developer Codebase Guide

This document is a narration-ready introduction to the Semantra codebase. It is meant for a developer who wants one structured pass through the Python project without jumping between many files first.

Use this guide together with the existing primary docs:

- `README.md` for product posture and local startup.
- `PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md` for architecture and the bounded-AI operating model.
- `project_docs/current_state.md` for the authoritative list of implemented product behavior.
- `project_docs/plan.md` and `project_docs/epics.md` for forward-looking work.

As of 2026-05-18, Semantra is a FastAPI backend plus a Streamlit UI over a SQLite persistence layer. The dominant product loop is:

1. ingest source and target structure
2. build schema profiles
3. rank mapping candidates with deterministic signals
4. guide review with bounded AI where useful
5. preview, transform, benchmark, and persist governed artifacts

## How To Read The Repo

If you are new to Semantra, start in this order:

1. `README.md`
2. `PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md`
3. `backend/app/main.py`
4. `backend/app/models/mapping.py`
5. `backend/app/services/mapping_service.py`
6. `streamlit_app.py`
7. `streamlit_ui/workspace_views.py`
8. `backend/app/services/persistence_service.py`
9. `backend/app/services/metadata_knowledge_service.py`
10. `backend/tests/test_mapping_service.py`

That path gives you the product story, API surface, core models, ranking engine, UI shell, persistence layer, and a realistic test anchor.

## Architectural Orientation

- `backend/app/main.py` wires the API routes.
- `backend/app/models/*` defines the core domain payloads shared across flows.
- `backend/app/services/*` holds the real product behavior: ingestion, ranking, review guidance, governance, persistence, overlays, evaluation, and generation.
- `streamlit_app.py` and `streamlit_ui/*` render the product surface and call the backend through a thin HTTP client.
- `backend/tests/*` and `tests/*` provide targeted regression coverage for backend and Streamlit helper logic.

Two practical boundaries matter while developing:

- the ranking path is deterministic-first, with LLM use only in bounded and inspectable surfaces
- governance rules are real backend contracts, not just UI hints

## Root-Level Python Files

- `streamlit_app.py`: main Streamlit entrypoint and top-level UI shell; keeps many helper imports local so AST-based tests can load specific functions without importing the whole UI stack.

## Support Utilities

- `support/vendor_ingest/parse_hrdh_columns.py`: offline utility that parses an HR Data Hub Excel export and emits a knowledge overlay CSV plus candidate canonical additions.
- `support/vendor_ingest/parse_workday_xsd.py`: offline utility that parses Workday XSD metadata and produces a knowledge overlay CSV plus canonical concept suggestions.
- `support/sap/*`: offline SAP inventory, promotion, prioritization, and context-materialization scripts used to produce reviewable runtime artifacts without polluting the repo root.

## Backend Application

### App Entry

- `backend/app/main.py`: creates the FastAPI app, configures CORS, and mounts the upload, mapping, catalog, evaluation, knowledge, and observability routers.

### Core Infrastructure

- `backend/app/core/config.py`: central settings loader; reads `.env` and environment variables for scoring thresholds, provider selection, TTS, CORS, SQLite path, and admin token behavior.
- `backend/app/core/logging.py`: tiny logging bootstrap used before the FastAPI app is created.

### API Dependencies

- `backend/app/api/deps.py`: admin-token dependency that guards protected routes when `SEMANTRA_ADMIN_API_TOKEN` is configured.

### API Routes

- `backend/app/api/routes/upload.py`: ingest endpoints for row-data files, SQL snapshots, schema-spec uploads, and companion metadata enrichment.
- `backend/app/api/routes/mapping.py`: main mapping workflow routes, including sync/async mapping, review-related actions, preview/codegen-adjacent flows, and mapping-set governance operations.
- `backend/app/api/routes/catalog.py`: catalog search, approved integration detail, and reuse-fit surfaces.
- `backend/app/api/routes/evaluation.py`: benchmark dataset CRUD-like flows, benchmark runs, scoring-profile comparison, and correction-impact evaluation.
- `backend/app/api/routes/knowledge.py`: canonical glossary, overlay lifecycle, stewardship items, import/export, runtime reload, and field-hint related endpoints.
- `backend/app/api/routes/observability.py`: runtime config inspection/reload, decision-log and correction inspection, plus admin observability endpoints.

### Domain Models

- `backend/app/models/mapping.py`: the largest domain model file; defines mapping candidates, mapping responses, scoring signals, canonical details, transformation preview warnings, mapping-set records, benchmark records, catalog records, and related request/response contracts.
- `backend/app/models/schema.py`: models for schema profiling, dataset handles, column statistics, preview rows, and detected pattern categories.
- `backend/app/models/knowledge.py`: models for canonical glossary entries, overlay rows, stewardship records, source field hints, and knowledge runtime status.

### Services

- `backend/app/services/prompt_templates.py`: central authoring layer for static bounded prompt text; keeps system instructions, task instructions, and payload labels consistent across review guidance, Workspace Copilot, canonical-gap, benchmark, reuse-fit, spec-recovery, validation, and transformation flows.
- `backend/app/services/evaluation_service.py`: evaluates mappings against saved benchmark datasets and compares scoring profiles or correction impact.

Prompt inventory note:
For the current matrix of prompt surfaces, static template locations, dynamic payload builders, and response contracts, see `docs/reference/LLM_PROMPT_MATRIX.md`.
For the acceptance checklist used when revising those prompts, see `docs/reference/LLM_PROMPT_EVALUATION_CHECKLIST.md`.

PR template note:
Use `.github/pull_request_template.md` for normal product, backend, UI, docs, config, and test changes.
If a PR changes bounded prompt text, prompt payload shape, prompt labels, or LLM response contracts, also use `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE/prompt-change.md` as the review checklist for that PR.

## Practical Mental Model For New Developers

When you change behavior in Semantra, ask which layer actually owns the contract:

- if the issue is parsing or schema inference, start in `tabular_upload_service.py`, `spec_upload_service.py`, `schema_snapshot_service.py`, or `profiling_service.py`
- if the issue is ranking or mapping confidence, start in `mapping_service.py`
- if the issue is canonical matching or overlay behavior, start in `metadata_knowledge_service.py` and `knowledge_overlay_service.py`
- if the issue is output generation or transformation preview, start in `transformation_service.py`, `preview_service.py`, or `codegen_service.py`
- if the issue is UI-only workflow state, start in `streamlit_ui/mapping_state.py` or the relevant `streamlit_ui/*_views.py`
- if the issue concerns durable artifacts, audit, or list/detail behavior, start in `persistence_service.py`

## Important Development Notes

- The product is deterministic-first. LLM usage is bounded and should stay optional, inspectable, and close to a concrete workflow step.
- Governance rules are enforced at the backend. Do not rely on Streamlit-only checks for approved-only or accepted-only flows.
- Mapping jobs are currently in-memory and thread-based. Do not assume they are restart-safe or cross-process-safe.
- Canonical and knowledge runtime are DB-first at runtime, but still support file-backed seed and reseed behavior.
- The largest blast-radius files today are `backend/app/services/persistence_service.py`, `backend/app/services/metadata_knowledge_service.py`, `backend/app/services/mapping_service.py`, and `streamlit_ui/admin_views.py`.

## Closing Orientation

Semantra is not organized like a thin CRUD app. The real product behavior sits in the service layer, while the Streamlit side mostly orchestrates user-facing flows over that backend. If you understand `mapping_service.py`, `metadata_knowledge_service.py`, `persistence_service.py`, `streamlit_app.py`, and the Workspace review views, you understand most of the system's current center of gravity.
